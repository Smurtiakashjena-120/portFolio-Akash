                hii there! i'm originally from Odisha. I finished my school journey at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in 2022. After some intense JEE coaching with the Dakshana Foundation, I got a taste of leadership and communication skills at a workshop in IIT Gandhinagar.
    
    Now, I'm on a new adventure at NIT Trichy, India's top NIT, pursuing a B.Tech in ECE (2023-2027). When not hitting the books, you can find me on the badminton and basketball courts, enjoying some tunes, or getting lost in web series and movies.
    I recently dipped my toes into the world of web development. Learning the ropes from various sources, I'm keen to connect with fellow learners. If you're also navigating the web dev landscape, let's team up and learn together!
    
    Join me on this page as I share my experiences, from academic pursuits to the joys of coding. It's a journey of discovery, and I'd love to have you along!
